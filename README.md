Description 1/25/2017--I have gotten all the pokemon and all the moves on 2 exel sheets and am currently assigning each their moves. I have also began coding the mthod that will extract the information from the sheet and imput it into the program as a 2D array.

1/27/2017--I now need to begin to initilize the graphics so I can do I test battle with only words but still in the graphics screen, 
however today I am moving slow so I am going to just do some assigning of pokemon to their moves so I don't waste time.
 
 
 1/31/17--I successfully opened the graphics screen and wrote down text for the demo version number one and I am to the point of beginning to work on the menu for the encounter screen.
 
 2/2/17--I finished the beginings of the battle demo menu  and successfully retrieved information from the exel sheet. Now I am beggining to move on to the selection menu where the user can select moves to use or other options.
