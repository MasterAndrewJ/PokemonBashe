Description
1/25/2017--I have gotten all the pokemon and all the moves on 2 exel sheets and am currently assigning each their moves. I have also began coding the mthod that will extract the information from the sheet and imput it
into the program as a 2D array.

1/27/2017--I now need to begin to initilize the graphics so I can do I test battle with only words but still in the graphics scree, however today I feel dead on the inside so I am going to just do some assigning of pokemon to their moves so I don't waste time.
