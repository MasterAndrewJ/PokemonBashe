Description 1/25/2017--I have gotten all the pokemon and all the moves on 2 exel sheets and am currently assigning each their moves. I have also began coding the mthod that will extract the information from the sheet and imput it into the program as a 2D array.

1/27/2017--I now need to begin to initilize the graphics so I can do I test battle with only words but still in the graphics screen, 
however today I am moving slow so I am going to just do some assigning of pokemon to their moves so I don't waste time.

Git hub is one of the worst programs I have ever worked with. It is not user friend, it lack the essential function of a delete folder button, and you cannot edit files easily from with in it not to metion the issues with comunication. This program is pathetic and I fail to see that advantages of it beside Mr.Hudson perhaps being able to moniter progress but there are many better solutions to this problem.
